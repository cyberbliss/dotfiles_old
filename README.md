# Dotfiles for Ubuntu

Initial config for Ubuntu environments. Tested with 20.04 (focal).

## Usage
Install git: `sudo apt install git`

Clone this repo into ~/dev_work:  
```
git clone https://github.com/cyberbliss/dotfiles.git ~/dev_work/dotfiles
```

cd into ~/dev_work/dotfiles and execute setup.sh

## Final steps
Make zsh the default shell: `chsh -s $(which zsh)` (you'll need the account's pw)
